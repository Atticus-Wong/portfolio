### Proxmox, DevOps, and Personal Cloud Environments
##### January 2026 - Atticus Wong

I was first introduced to Proxmox by a co-worker during the Summer of '25 while discussing Infrastructure as Code. Although it initially seemed perplexing, I decided it was worth at least thirty minutes of investigation. I ended up running Proxmox on my old high school laptop, which opened a whole can of worms and kickstarted my journey into self-hosting. 

This article covers that journey, sharing how I reached my current setup along with various tricks I've picked up along the way. In fact, this very portfolio application is deployed through a Jenkins project and hosted on a Debian VM within my PVE!

#### Background
For those new to the self-hosting space, Proxmox is a hypervisor/virtualization management platform that can split hardware resources and create VMs and LXCs, and offers a web-interface to manage your environment. The technology is simple but grounded, giving users the flexibility to choose architect their own PVE. 

One of the biggest downsides to proxmox is it's network. A vanilla instance of proxmox is constrained to LAN, where a user can only interact with the VMs and containers under a shared network. This is where technologies like Wireguard and Tailscale powerfully unlock the full potential of Proxmox, turning a local service into what I like to call a **Personal Cloud Environment**. Tailscale and Wireguard are VPN services that create network tunnels, connecting devices across the internet as if they were on the same LAN, meaning you can access services from anywhere.
