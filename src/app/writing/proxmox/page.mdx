### Proxmox, DevOps, and Personal Cloud Environments
##### January 2026 - Atticus Wong

I was first introduced to Proxmox by a co-worker during the Summer of '25 while discussing Infrastructure as Code. Although it initially seemed perplexing, I decided it was worth at least thirty minutes of investigation. I ended up running Proxmox on my old high school laptop, which opened a whole can of worms and kickstarted my journey into self-hosting. 

This article covers that journey, sharing my current setup along with various tricks I've picked up along the way. In fact, this very portfolio application is deployed through a Jenkins project and hosted on a Debian VM within my PVE!

#### Background
For those new to the self-hosting space, Proxmox is a hypervisor/virtualization management platform that can split hardware resources and create VMs and LXCs, and offers a web-interface to manage your environment. The technology is simple but grounded, giving users the flexibility to choose architect their own PVE. 

One of the biggest downsides to proxmox is it's network. A vanilla instance of proxmox is constrained to LAN, where a user can only interact with the VMs and containers under a shared network. This is where technologies like Wireguard and Tailscale powerfully unlock the full potential of Proxmox, turning a local service into what I like to call a **Personal Cloud Environment**. Tailscale and Wireguard are VPN services that create network tunnels, connecting devices across the internet as if they were on the same LAN, meaning you can access services from anywhere.


#### My Current setup

My current setup is built around a suite of core applications consisting of Booklore for reading, Pi-hole for network-wide ad blocking, and Immich for self-hosted cloud photo storage. To manage automation and deployments, I also run a dedicated Jenkins instance hosted on a Debian virtual machine.

#### Building on Abstractions
While the self-hosted apps are very handy and cost-efficient, the biggest benefit of my Proxmox instance are the things it has taught me about deployment, Cloud Infra, and DevOps. It's given me a tangible perspective on what it means to **build on top of abstractions**, specifically through VM spinups.

VMs typically come without any pre-installed software, but as a software engineer, I prefer my environments to be production-ready and equipped with tools like Docker, curl, and my SSH keys. To achieve this, I built custom VM templates and cloud-init images on Proxmox, giving me the option to spinup pre-configured VMs. I took this a step further by creating an automation pipeline in Jenkins that provisions a VM on my PVE at the click of a button, complete with useful build parameters. By hiding the details of VM provisioning behind a simple interface, I've abstracted the infrastructure lifecycle, allowing me to jump straight to building and deploying applications on top of this automated layer.

> Note: The deployment of my portfolio is also abstracted away behind a Jenkins Pipeline!

#### Next steps
I hope to expand my homelab with more proxmox clusters, and eventually add some GPUs to play around with self-hosted LLMs.

I'm still only just exploring the world of self-hosting and software engineering and would love to hear about your experience with homelabbing and self-hosting!
