### Crafting the Perfect Development Environment
##### February 2026 - Atticus Wong

I've spent upwards of 40 hours optimizing my personal development environment. Why so much, you might ask?

Because I believe one small optimization in an engineers workflow pays dividends over the course of their lifetime.

I've touched all development tools under the sun to find what kind of workflow works best for me (okay, maybe not all but definitely a lot), and here are the best tools I've found that help push me closer and closer to being a 10x engineer.

Brainstorm:
#### What doesn't work for me and why
- VSCode
- 

#### My Personal Development Environment (there is an art to simplicity)
- Nvim
- Raycast
- Opencode
- Google Gemini
